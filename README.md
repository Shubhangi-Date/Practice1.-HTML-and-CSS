# Practice1.-HTML-and-CSS
I create basic page using HTML and CSS for the first time.
It includes the navbar, search bar and logo at the top.
below that a container which includes the logo, title and some description and also added a two buttons.
After this I include three times the title, image and some description like a blog.
